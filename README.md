## Design Choices ##
​
### Fonts ###
​
We chose the [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) font for the h1-h3 and the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text_type=custom) font as basic and Sans-Serif as default font.
​
### Colours ###
​
We chose for the website the Irish and St. Patricks Day colours.<br>
​
​
​
![Colour palette](assets/images/coolors-palette-sm.png)
​
- *Rich Black FOGRA 39* (#010800) - Black
- *Kombu Green* (#273301) - Dark olive green
- *Dark Spring Green* (#157347) - Dark green
- *Avocado* (#5A7502) - Avocado Green
- *Moss Green* (#879E46) - Light Green
- *Green Pigment* (#009B4B) - Bright Green
- *White* (#FFFFFF) - White
- *Heat Wave* (#FF7900) - Bright Orange


These colours will compliment each other well and provide the user with a distinct, recognisable  colour scheme commonly identified with St. Patrick's Day celebrations.

### Imagery ###
​
The background image with the shamrocks for the Body represent the luck of the irish.<br>
The Hero image is the irish flag in a banner desing.
​
### Wireframes ###
​

## Project Management ##
​
GitHub [Projects](project GitHub repo URL/projects) are used to organize the planning and development of the website.
Three GitHub projects are used to manage different aspects of the site development:
- [Development](project GitHub repo URL/projects/1)
  - Manages general project tasks and files including Documentation, HTML & CSS
- [Bug Fixes](project GitHub repo URL/projects)
  - Manages the triage and prioritization of the bug fixes.
​
The Projects are created using the following GitHub templates:
- `Automated kanban` template for the **Development** and **Development - JavaScript** projects 
- `Bug Triage` template for the **Bug Fixes** project.
​
The following kanban project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **Backlog** - this card is used to capture ideas for project tasks.
- **To Do** - this is the current work queue for the project.
- **In Progress** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **Testing** - Testing tasks list
- **Done** - completed tasks
​
The following Bug Triage template project cards are used to manage the Bux fixes tasks:
- **Needs Triage** - this card is used to capture new bugs prior to assigning a priority.
  - A triage card is more appropriate for larger projects than this but left in as this is where all new issues are assigned when linking a project to a new issue.
- **High Priority** - this is the high priority queue for the project.
- **Low Priority** - this is the low priority queue for the project.
- **Closed** - completed tasks.
​
Markdown syntax is used to create **"To-Do" list** style checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` for an un-ticked checkbox and `- [x]` for a ticked checkbox on cards as a way of splitting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.

## Version Control ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate forked repositories for each team member.

Each member synchronised their own GitHub repositories by adding an additional remote  named `upstream` linked to the team's main [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci) by entering the following steps Git commands:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

The following describes a typical Team Member's forked repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **Documentation** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
    - **Development** - this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development
    - Each individual **bug fixes** are raised within their own **separate branches** using the naming convention **\<GitHub Issue ID Number>-\<bug fix description>** e.g. branch name ***12-correct-navbar-links*** 
​
The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.
​
​
#### **Gitpod Workspaces** ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.
​
​
#### **Branches** ####
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. To create a **new branch** for bug fixes, use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.
​
​
#### **Working within a branch** ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronized, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.
​
​
#### **Merging branches in GitHub** ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to its related **Development**, **Development - JavaScript** or **Bug Fixes** project.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.
​
​
#### **Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits** ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.
    
#### **Pull Requests** ####

18. To update the upstream remote repository, each Team Member creates a pull request from the their forked master branch (`origin/master`) to the upstream Team repository (`upstream/master`)
19. The pull request is reviewed and any merge conflicts are resolved before merging into the upstream master branch.
20. Team Members must then fetch the latest commits again to their forked repositories using the following Git commands:

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

## Testing ##
​
- Testing information can be found in a separate [testing.md](testing.md) file.
​
---
## Bugs ##
​

To manage bugs and issues tracking, the default GitHub [bug_report.md template](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)) has been created and activated within the repository settings Features > Issues section.
All new bugs and issues are tracked within the GitHub repository [Issues section](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/issues) .
Open issues are managed within the [GitHub Projects section]([project GitHub repo URL/projects/projects](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/projects/1).

​
Each branch is then **merged** into the **master branch** using a **pull request** that is **linked** to the **open issue**. Once merged, and the bug report **closed**, the branch is **deleted**.
​
Fixed bugs and issues are marked as [closed](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
