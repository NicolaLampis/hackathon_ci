â€‹
### **Colours** ###
â€‹
We chose for the website the Irish and St. Patrick's Day colours.<br>

## **Development Lifecycle and Task Allocation** ##

- The Team is made up of all experience levels from those who have only just started the course, right up to Alumni.
  - Our first task was to figure out at which level everyone is and how much time each of us has.
- Our team is Suzy, Tobi, Laith, Nicola, Simon and Marina
- We split all the tasks between us based on our individual experience levels:
  - Suzy came up with this great quiz idea and wrote all the questions.
    - She created a huge part of the README including the User Stories
    - She also worked really well with Nicola, Tobi and Laith on the coding.
  - Marina worked on the website layout ideas
    - She created the wireframe, the design and game styling and took care of finding all the content images.
  - Simon helped us to get it set our team project on GitHub.
    - He provided us with everything what we need for our dashboard
    - Explained how to work with Forked repositories, and helped us patiently when we had trouble with fetching and merging branches as well as other queries and troubles.
      - We would be lost without him, or at least we wouldn't have made it so fast!
  - Tobi was behind creating the interactive game functionality in JavaScript and managed to solve the JSON file import (which was just awesome).
  - Laith and Nicola worked on creating the main website and supported Tobi with the JavaScript; linking it all together.
    - A big thank you to Nicola who hosted the master branch on his GitHub account and had all the work to do with the pull requests and merging as well as having to fix all the inevitable merge conflicts.
  - Simon and Nicola did all the unit testing and bug reporting.
- We had a fantastic team spirit and wish you could all see the slack channel conversations and collaboration!
  - We kept each other permanently up to date.
  - Helped each other where we could and what each was able to help with.
  - Every single one of us gave 100% and more to make sure that this website will be: 
    - Easy to understand and simple to use.
    - A lot of fun to play.

## **Project Management** ##
â€‹
GitHub [Projects](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/projects/) are used to organize the planning and development of the website.
Three GitHub projects are used to manage different aspects of the site development:
- [Steal the gold](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/projects/1)
  - Manages all project tasks and files including Documentation, HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
â€‹
The Projects are created using the following GitHub templates:
- `Automated kanban` template for the **Steal the gold** project
â€‹
The following kanban project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **Start** - this card is used to capture ideas for project tasks.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **In Work** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
- **Finished Tasks** - completed tasks
â€‹
â€‹
Markdown syntax is used to create **"To-Do" list** style checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` for an un-ticked checkbox and `- [x]` for a ticked checkbox on cards as a way of splitting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.

## **Version Control** ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate forked repositories for each team member.

Each member synchronised their own GitHub repositories by adding an additional remote  named `upstream` linked to the team's main [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci) by entering the following steps Git commands:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

The following describes a typical Team Member's forked repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **Documentation** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
    - **Development** - this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development
    - Each individual **bug fixes** are raised within their own **separate branches** using the naming convention **\<GitHub Issue ID Number>-\<bug fix description>** e.g. branch name ***12-correct-navbar-links*** 
â€‹
The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.
â€‹
â€‹
#### **Gitpod Workspaces** ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.
â€‹
â€‹
#### **Branches** ####
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. To create a **new branch** for bug fixes, use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.
â€‹
â€‹
#### **Working within a branch** ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronized, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.
â€‹
â€‹
#### **Merging branches in GitHub** ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to its related **Development**, **Development - JavaScript** or **Bug Fixes** project.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.
â€‹
â€‹
#### **Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits** ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.
    
#### **Pull Requests** ####

18. To update the upstream remote repository, each Team Member creates a pull request from the their forked master branch (`origin/master`) to the upstream Team repository (`upstream/master`)
19. The pull request is reviewed and any merge conflicts are resolved before merging into the upstream master branch.
20. Team Members must then fetch the latest commits again to their forked repositories using the following Git commands:

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

## **Testing** ##
â€‹
- Testing information can be found in a separate [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## **Bugs** ##
â€‹

To manage bugs and issues tracking, the default GitHub [bug_report.md template](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)) has been created and activated within the repository settings Features > Issues section.
All new bugs and issues are tracked within the GitHub repository [Issues section](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/issues) .
Open issues are managed within the [GitHub Projects section]([project GitHub repo URL/projects/projects](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/projects/1).

â€‹
Each branch is then **merged** into the **master branch** using a **pull request** that is **linked** to the **open issue**. Once merged, and the bug report **closed**, the branch is **deleted**.
â€‹
Fixed bugs and issues are marked as [closed](https://github.com/NicolaLampis/hackathon_ci/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
