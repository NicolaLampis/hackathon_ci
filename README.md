paint. net was used to create the wireframes during the design process.
[View the wireframes here.](assets/images/paddy-day-quizz.jpg)

​
#### Hand drawn drafts ####
​
The original hand drawn sketch wireframe was created as quick and rough method to try out page formatting ideas to form a basis for creating the wireframe within balsamic.
​
It represents the early stages of the design process for the website as ideas started to form and the flow of the design process from idea to finished website.

​
## Project Management ##
​
GitHub [Projects](project GitHub repo URL/projects) are used to organize the planning and development of the website.
Three GitHub projects are used to manage different aspects of the site development:
- [Development](project GitHub repo URL/projects/1)
  - Manages general project tasks and files including Documentation, HTML & CSS
- [Bug Fixes](project GitHub repo URL/projects)
  - Manages the triage and prioritization of the bug fixes.
​
The Projects are created using the following GitHub templates:
- `Automated kanban` template for the **Development** and **Development - JavaScript** projects 
- `Bug Triage` template for the **Bug Fixes** project.
​
The following kanban project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **Backlog** - this card is used to capture ideas for project tasks.
- **To Do** - this is the current work queue for the project.
- **In Progress** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **Testing** - Testing tasks list
- **Done** - completed tasks
​
The following Bug Triage template project cards are used to manage the Bux fixes tasks:
- **Needs Triage** - this card is used to capture new bugs prior to assigning a priority.
  - A triage card is more appropriate for larger projects than this but left in as this is where all new issues are assigned when linking a project to a new issue.
- **High Priority** - this is the high priority queue for the project.
- **Low Priority** - this is the low priority queue for the project.
- **Closed** - completed tasks.
​
Markdown syntax is used to create **"To-Do" list** style checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` for an un-ticked checkbox and `- [x]` for a ticked checkbox on cards as a way of splitting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.

​
## Version Control ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate [branches](project GitHub repo URL/branches)  used to work on specific aspects of the project.
The following describes the repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **Documentation** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
    - **Development** - this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development
    - Each individual **bug fixes** are raised within their own **separate branches** using the naming convention **\<GitHub Issue ID Number>-\<bug fix description>** e.g. branch name ***12-correct-navbar-links*** 
​
The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.
​
​
#### Gitpod Workspaces ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.
​
​
#### Branches ####
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. To create a **new branch** for bug fixes, use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.
​
​
#### Working within a branch ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronized, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.
​
​
#### Merging branches in GitHub ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to its related **Development**, **Development - JavaScript** or **Bug Fixes** project.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.
​
​
#### Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.
​
---
## Testing ##
​
- Testing information can be found in a separate [testing.md](testing.md) file.
​
---
## Bugs ##
​
To manage bugs and issues tracking, the default GitHub [bug_report.md template](project GitHub repo URL/projects/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) has been created and activated within the repository settings Features > Issues section.
All new bugs and issues are tracked within the GitHub repository [Issues section](project GitHub repo URL/issues) .
Open issues are managed within the [GitHub Projects section](project GitHub repo URL/projects/projects)
​
Each branch is then **merged** into the **master branch** using a **pull request** that is **linked** to the **open issue**. Once merged, and the bug report **closed**, the branch is **deleted**.
​
Fixed bugs and issues are marked as [closed](<GitHub Repo>/<Repo Name>/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
​
---
​
## Deployment ##
​
The website was developed using both *Gitpod* and *Visual Studio Code* and using *Git* pushed to *GitHub*, which hosts the repository. I made the following steps to deploy the site using *GitHub Pages*:
​
- Opened up **GitHub** in the browser.
- Signed in with my **username** and **password**.
- Selected my **repositories**.
- Navigated to **simonjvardy/alarm-clock**.
- In the top navigation clicked **settings**.
- Scrolled down to the **GitHub Pages** area.
- Selected **Master Branch** from the **Source** dropdown menu.
- Clicked to **confirm** my **selection**.
- [<GitHub Repo Name>](GitHub Repo URL) is now **live** on **GitHub Pages**.
​
### Running Locally ###
​
Cloning alarm-clock from GitHub:
​
- Navigate to **<GitHub>/<Repo Name>**.
- Click the **Code** button.
- **Copy** the url in the dropdown box.
- Using your favourite **IDE** open up your preferred terminal.
- **Navigate** to your desired file location.
​
Copy the following code and input it into your terminal to clone alarm-clock:

GitHub [Projects](project GitHub repo URL/projects) are used to organize the planning and development of the website.
Three GitHub projects are used to manage different aspects of the site development:
- [Development](project GitHub repo URL/projects/1)
  - Manages general project tasks and files including Documentation, HTML & CSS
- [Bug Fixes](project GitHub repo URL/projects)
  - Manages the triage and prioritization of the bug fixes.
​
The Projects are created using the following GitHub templates:
- `Automated kanban` template for the **Development** and **Development - JavaScript** projects 
- `Bug Triage` template for the **Bug Fixes** project.
​
The following kanban project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **Backlog** - this card is used to capture ideas for project tasks.
- **To Do** - this is the current work queue for the project.
- **In Progress** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **Testing** - Testing tasks list
- **Done** - completed tasks
​
The following Bug Triage template project cards are used to manage the Bux fixes tasks:
- **Needs Triage** - this card is used to capture new bugs prior to assigning a priority.
  - A triage card is more appropriate for larger projects than this but left in as this is where all new issues are assigned when linking a project to a new issue.
- **High Priority** - this is the high priority queue for the project.
- **Low Priority** - this is the low priority queue for the project.
- **Closed** - completed tasks.
​
Markdown syntax is used to create **"To-Do" list** style checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` for an un-ticked checkbox and `- [x]` for a ticked checkbox on cards as a way of splitting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.

## Version Control ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate [branches](project GitHub repo URL/branches)  used to work on specific aspects of the project.
The following describes the repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **Documentation** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
    - **Development** - this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development
    - Each individual **bug fixes** are raised within their own **separate branches** using the naming convention **\<GitHub Issue ID Number>-\<bug fix description>** e.g. branch name ***12-correct-navbar-links*** 
​
The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.
​
​
#### Gitpod Workspaces ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.
​
​
#### Branches ####
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. To create a **new branch** for bug fixes, use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.
​
​
#### Working within a branch ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronized, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.
​
​
#### Merging branches in GitHub ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to its related **Development**, **Development - JavaScript** or **Bug Fixes** project.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.
​
​
#### Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.

## Testing ##
​
- Testing information can be found in a separate [testing.md](testing.md) file.
​
---
## Bugs ##
​
To manage bugs and issues tracking, the default GitHub [bug_report.md template](project GitHub repo URL/projects/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) has been created and activated within the repository settings Features > Issues section.
All new bugs and issues are tracked within the GitHub repository [Issues section](project GitHub repo URL/issues) .
Open issues are managed within the [GitHub Projects section](project GitHub repo URL/projects/projects)
​
Each branch is then **merged** into the **master branch** using a **pull request** that is **linked** to the **open issue**. Once merged, and the bug report **closed**, the branch is **deleted**.
​
Fixed bugs and issues are marked as [closed](<GitHub Repo>/<Repo Name>/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
